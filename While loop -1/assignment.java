// Q 1

// Write a program to print all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user

      int n = scn.nextInt(); 
int i = 1; 
while (i <= n){
	System.out.print(i + " ");
	i++; 
}


Q2 

Write a program to print all Natural numbers from N to 1 where you have to take N as input from user
 int n = scn.nextInt(); 
        int i = n; 
        while (i >= 1){
	        System.out.print(i + " ");
	        i--; 
        }

//  Q3 
//  Write a program to print all odd numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user. Here N is inclusive.
 
 int n = scn.nextInt(); 
 int i = 1; 
 while(i <= n){
	 if (i % 2 != 0){
		 System.out.print(i + " ");
	 }
	 i++; 
 }
 

 
 Q4 
 
 Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from the user. Note: Use while-loop OR for-loop, according to session flow.


 
 int n = scn.nextInt(); 
 int i = 1; 
 while(i <= n){
	 if (i % 2 == 0){
		 System.out.print(i + " ");
	 }
	 i++; 
 }
 
 
 

 
 Q5 
 
 Write a program to find sum all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user


 
 int n = scn.nextInt(); 
 int i = 0 ; 
 int sum = 0 ; 
 
while(i<=n){
	sum = sum + i ; 
	i++ ; 

}System.out.println(sum);
